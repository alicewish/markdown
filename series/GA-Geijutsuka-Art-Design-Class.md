GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class

It's Kisaragi's first year in G.A.: the specialized art and design department at her high school. The timid Kisaragi has a lot to learn, but with the help of a very unique group of friends, even the most difficult lesson becomes loads of fun - if not downright silly! With the aid of full-color pages throughout, you too can learn the basics of color theory and become a great artist yourself! Satoko Kiyuduki, creator of Shoulder-a-Coffin Kuro, melds art class and manga in a whole new way!
