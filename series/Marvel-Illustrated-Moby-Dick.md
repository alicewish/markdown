Marvel Illustrated: Moby Dick (2008)

Melville's seafaring masterpiece is brought to stirring life in the pages of the Marvel Illustrated line. Young sailor Ishmael signs onto the whaling ship, Pequod. Soon, he comes to question his judgment as the vessel sets sail and he meets the strange crew sailing with him. Strangest of all is the mysterious Captain Ahab, whose obsession with the great white whale who once bit off his leg may lead them all to a watery doom. It's been called The Great American Novel. And they weren't kidding.
