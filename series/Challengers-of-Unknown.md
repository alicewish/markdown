Challengers of the Unknown (1958-1978)

From the late 1950s, these are the original tales of four death-defying adventurers and their impossible, unimaginable exploits. After surviving the crash of a small aircraft, test pilot Ace Morgan, daredevil Red Ryan, heavyweight boxing champ Rocky Davis and marine scientist Professor Haley unite as The Challengers of The Unknown. Their mission: to explore the unexplainable for the good of mankind. This beautiful hardcover edition tells the earliest adventurers of these four adventurers as they encounter powerful aliens, deadly robots, and creatures of unknown origins, including a mysterious "star stone" that bestows super-powers, a space circus, monsters from space, a planet populated by robots and more.



Challengers of the Unknown (1991)

They were four middle-aged men who seemed to have it all. Wealth. Power. Fame. The world adores them - Rocky Davis, Ace Morgan, Red Ryan and Prof. Haley - together known as the CHALLENGERS OF THE UNKNOWN. Unfortunately, in a single devastating instant, all their fame and popularity is destroyed when an experiment conducted by Prof. Haley seemingly goes wrong, killing hundreds along with Prof. and his assistant, June. The surviving Challengers go their separate ways, seeking to fill the voids in their lives. But no matter what divergent roads they take, they're destined to be drawn together again by a mysterious force that's driving normal people to commit horrendous acts of crime and violence...and to discover what really happened to Prof. Haley and June.

To survive, they must unite and face the true masters of our universe. It's a world where literally anything can happen, and probably will!
