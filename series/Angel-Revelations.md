Angel: Revelations (2008)

Warren Worthington III has it made. A senior at St. Joseph's Prep, he's smart, tall, handsome, and rich; a star both on the field and in the classroom. All the girls want to date him, all the guys want to be him. There's just one problem...Warren's changing. Something's happening to his body-humps have started to grow under his shoulder blades, and they're getting bigger and more painful every day. See the never-before-told origin of one of the X-Men's five founding members, and his first encounter with an unsolvable, unrelenting evil...the Hunter.
