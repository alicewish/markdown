Star Trek: The Next Generation: Ghosts

Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise respond to a distress call and find a terribly wounded scientist aboard a marooned ship. While evaluating the planet below (and its two warring nations) for possible Federation membership, Picard discovers to his horror that the survivor of the disaster is foreseeing his death. Written by Eisner-nominated writer Zander Cannon (Top Ten).
