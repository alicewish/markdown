Archie's Rival Reggie

Yes! Archie's arch-rival, Reggie, has his own comic book! In "Ferocious Fems", Reggie decides to coach the girls in their first-ever girls' football game (traditionally known as the Powderpuff football)! But it's gonna take a lot of work to get these young ladies into gridiron material! Will Reggie fumble this opportunity, or can he bring it in for a touchdown?
