The Call of Duty: The Brotherhood (2002)

Meet James MacDonald, a lieutenant fireman in Brooklyn, stationed right across the bridge from where the Twin Towers used to stand. MacDonald knows that, even with super heroes flying overhead, someone has to put out fires and respond to everyday emergencies. With modern-day gods making headlines, ordinary people must still put their life on the line for others. But what happens to these heroic individuals when that other world, the world of super powered, supernatural beings touches the lives of these brave citizens? What happens when MacDonald must confront forces beyond his normal experience? Find out when all-new heroes step forward to answer THE CALL!
