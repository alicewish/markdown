Artesia: Afire

The third chapter in Mark Smylie's epic fantasy. After claiming the throne of Dara Dess, Artesia and allies pursue the Thessid vanguard. But wary of battle with a trapped and desperate enemy, she tries to make her first victory as one won with words, not swords. Includes a short prologue following King Bran's head as Urgrayne takes him to meet her Three Sisters.
