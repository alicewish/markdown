Black Op

It's 1945. Floyd Whitman discovers that 'those scumbag communists' have killed his father. He's just a child, but he resolves to one day join the CIA. By 2003, America has triumphed over the Soviet Union, but the Russian mafia has become the most powerful, and certainly the most violent criminal group throughout the whole country. Through the fate of one man--young and full of illusions in 1965, but rather more embittered in 2003--we see the CIA help the Russian mafia get back on its feet in the squalid back rooms of the American empire. A great spy adventure comparable with the best of Hollywood thrillers.
