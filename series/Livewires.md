Livewires (2006)

Hollowpoint Ninja. Gothic Lolita. Cornfed. Stem Cell. Social Butterfly. They're nanobuilt humanform combat mecha, with "smartware" bodies specialized for covert ops and Artificially Intelligent minds programmed for suicidal loyalty. They're the superhuman products of a top-secret, quasi-governmental R&D program with a unique agenda: namely, to seek out and destroy other top-secret, quasi-governmental R&D programs. And in the ultratech underbelly of a Marvel Universe infested with mad super geniuses, homebrewed WMDs, and bootlegged alien technologies, they have a lot of work to do.
