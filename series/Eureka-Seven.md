Eureka Seven

Renton Thurston is a young 14-year-old who is tired of his monotonous life. His feelings of frustration come from his life of toil in his grandfather's garage and being the son of an enigmatic, legendary hero. The only thing that makes Renton happy is when he lifts, an extreme form of aerial hover-boarding. One day a large LFO (Light Finding Operation) craft called Nirvash falls from the sky and a beautiful young girl named Eureka emerges and asks for repairs. When a smitten Renton literally falls over himself to help her, the two begin a journey that will change both their destinies...
