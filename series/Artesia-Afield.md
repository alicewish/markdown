Artesia: Afield

Now's your chance to recapture the magic of the second chapter of Mark Smylie's epic tale. The war against the Thessid Empire has begun in the Middle Kingdoms, and Artesia has placed her company at the heart of it. As a battle is waged against the dreaded Dumeghal, warrior-servants of the Isliklids, Artesia is filled with a sense of unease that permeates the Middle Kingdoms as she struggles with her visions of guilty pasts and dark futures.
