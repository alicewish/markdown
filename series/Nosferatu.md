Nosferatu

A symphony of shadows...a symphony of shudders. Beyond the Carpathian Mountains, in the land called Transylvania, there lived a monster that preyed on men and fed on their blood. It crossed the sea by day, driven by a greater need than the bloodlust, to seek out a woman of great beauty and great power. Featuring the comic adaptation of F. W. Murnau's classic silent film of life and undeath. The first issue of the expressionistic classic that was released as a German film in the 1920's, it was notable for being the first incarnation of a filmed version of Dracula although the names were changed to avoid a lawsuit with the Stoker estate. However, the estate sued anyway and all prints were ordered destroyed. Fortunately, some of the prints survived to allow the classic to come to light. Here is part one of the adaptation of that film.
