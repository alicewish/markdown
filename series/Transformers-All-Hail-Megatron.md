Transformers: All Hail Megatron

The DECEPTICONS have won, the AUTOBOTS are defeated, and the time for conquest is at hand! Or is it? This all-new series written by Shane McCarthy and featuring art by Guido Guidi picks up one year after the Revelations saga, and finds the DECEPTICONS alone and triumphant on Earth, with not an AUTOBOT in sight. With no one to stand in their way, how will the planet survive? And what of the missing AUTOBOTS? The biggest, most epic TRANSFORMERS storyline ever starts here!
