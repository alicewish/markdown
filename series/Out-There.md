Out There

What’s to Love: Collected in its entirety for the first time! From acclaimed Crimson creators Brian Augustyn (Batman: Gotham By Gaslight) and Humberto Ramos (Spider-Man) comes the first collection of Out There, returning readers to the haunting of John C. Fremont High School, featuring a brand-new cover and a new story by Ramos. What It Is: El Dorado City: a picturesque town with good people. All lies. In the midst of high school’s usual horrors, four unlikely students bear witness to the end times. Possessing the ability to see and hear those drifting into our word, it is up to Zach, Casey, Jessica and Mark to find a way to stop the army of demonic creatures plaguing their home. Collects issues #1-6. “Out There could very well be one of the better non-superhero titles on the stands.” - Comics Bulletin
