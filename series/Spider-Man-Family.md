Spider-Man Family (2005)

Of all Spider-Man's many foes, the Jackal and the Hobgoblin are two of the most tenacious. Both master manipulators, they've caused Spidey pain aplenty in the past -- and now their shadows are again looming large! As a great evil emerges, peel back the layers of time and learn where it all began as we present the Jackal and Hobgoblin's classic first appearances, fully remastered with modern coloring!



Spider-Man Family (2007-2008)

A feature-length tale starring Spider-Man's alien costume and guest-starring the Sandman! Peter Parker would love nothing more than to get a good night's sleep, but his sleek, symbiotic suit has plans of its own...and no one is gonna get in its way! Plus, a heaping helping of classic Spidey stories!
