Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn (1989-1990)

Hal Jordan…as a young boy, he watched his father make aviation history before tragedy struck. As an adult, he dealt with that tragedy. Then came the fateful day when a flight simulator test and a flash of green light led him to a crashed alien spaceship, a ring…and a beginning that would lead to intergalactic fame. GREEN LANTERN: EMERALD DAWN is the saga of Hal Jordan, from his childhood through his test pilot days. The tale traces his discovery of a great power and his learning to use that power, which will someday make him the greatest of all the Green Lanterns.
