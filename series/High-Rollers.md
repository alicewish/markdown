High Rollers

Scarface has nothing on Cameron Quinn, a ruthless upstart out to make a name for himself in this tale of crime and destiny from critically acclaimed mystery novelist Gary Phillips (HIGH HAND, BANGERS)! Phillips shines a harsh light on the action and drama of the L.A. underworld with this inner-cityspin on The Sopranos! A potent mix of American Gangster and THE WIRE, for fans of Brubaker's CRIMINAL!
