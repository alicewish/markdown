Archie's Girls Betty and Veronica

Betty & Veronica star in their first comic book! In "Circus Daze", Betty inherits her Uncle Oscar's  favorite car! Too bad Uncle Oscar is a clown! Will Betty & Veronica be able to get home in this crazy clown car? Then, in "What's Cookin'?", Betty feels the fool for slipping Archie cake and doughnuts by way of the empty emergency fire bucket in the hall! But Archie hasn't been eating those treats at all! Who is the baked good bandit?
