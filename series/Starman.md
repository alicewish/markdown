Starman (1988-1992)

There have been a number of Starmen on the scene since the 1940s, from the cosmic rod-wielding hero of the Golden Age to the science fiction warrior of the 1970s. But you haven't seen anything like this wild interpretation of Starman. The name may be the same, but that's where all similarities end. Starman's a super-hero who doesn't know how he got to be that way...or even the full extent of his spectacular powers. He's a man who doesn't know who he is or where he came from. But that doesn't mean he can't put his powers to good use while he's waiting to find out. 



Starman (1994-2001)

Jack Knight, the son of the Golden Age Starman, reluctantly assumes the family legacy as protector of Opal City, a bustling Metropolis with all manner of citizens--and deadly enemies. Join Jack as he discovers what it means to be a hero in adventures that traverse all corners of the DC Universe.
