A Treasury of Victorian Murder

This second volume of Rick Geary's Treasury of Victorian Murder explores the ghastliest and most famous murders of Victorian England. Rick has researched this book extensively and presents, with his own inimitable tongue-in-cheek style, the Jack The Ripper mystery as told through a journal of a fascinated Englishman of the day. Both factual and darkly funny, Geary's personal take on this story shines an ironic light on the repressive society that spawned such a monster. 



"Geary's haunting drawings unite seamlessly with his moody, well-researched text." --Publishers Weekly



"Expertly designed and drawn." --Ellery Queen
