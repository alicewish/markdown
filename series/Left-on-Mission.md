Left on Mission

Former agent Eric Westfall has been called out of his perfect suburban retirement, complete with wife and kid, to recover an agent gone rogue.



He has to stop his target from auctioning a stolen hard-drive, chock full of classified info, on the black market for $50 million. His mission - turn the target back into a loyal agent for the government, or kill them.



But things get complicated when it's revealed that Westfall has been called back to duty specifically because he has history with his target - romantic history. Will he be able to take down Emma, his ex-lover?



Left on Mission is a five issue mini-series for fans of gritty, dark espionage thrillers like Casino Royale and The Bourne Identity!
