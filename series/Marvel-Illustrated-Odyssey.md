Marvel Illustrated: The Odyssey (2008-2009)

Odysseus, one of the great Greek warriors of the Trojan War, has not arrived home. His ship is blown off course by the vengeful sea god Poseidon, thus leading the hero into a series of awesome adventures that form a cornerstone of Western literature. This Homeric epic has been told and retold and now it receives the grand Marvel Illustrated treatment courtesy of classic scribe Roy Thomas (THE ILIAD) and penciler Greg Tocchini (THOR: SON OF ASGARD). It's the greatest voyage in all mythology and it begins here.
